+ ### Design
* _Color Scheme_
    * The main color of the game is darkorange and antiquewhite for the text.
    * Red and yellow are for the button and card borders

* Typography
    * The **Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif** font is the main font used throughout the game.
    * As a typeface, Arial is one of the most used designs in recent times thanks to the fact that it has specific characteristics that make it more accessible and it has become a basic element for textual content.
    Arial typeface is easy to read in a variety of sizes and in a variety of applications, not only on screen but also in print.
    * The **Helvetica** family is characterized by its neutrality, versatility and high readability. It is a very suitable typeface for informational posters.
    * **Sans serif** it is usually used for titles that seek to make an impact, for headlines that must be read from a distance or for reading bodies that are relatively short.
    
* Imagery
    * Imagery is the face of the game. Though the background its just a color. The main goal of the game are the images used. The images are inspired in the covid-19 advises, and work as a reminder of what we must do nowadays to stay safe. 
    * The reason why the game do not have a background image and just color is to make it more easier for the user to concentrate on the game cards.
